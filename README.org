* Hare
Work in progress.

At the end Hare should work similar to TortoiseSVN so that most
version control operations can be performed directly in Dired, i.e.
no need to switch between Dired and VC-Dir or any other version
control interface.

** To Do
- [ ] Add context menu to run version control commands.
