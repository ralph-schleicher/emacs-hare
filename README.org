* HareSVN
This is work in progress.  However, the functionality and maturity is
sufficient for HareSVN development itself.

At the end HareSVN should work similar to TortoiseSVN so that most
version control operations can be performed directly in Dired, i.e.
no need to switch between Dired and VC-Dir or any other version
control interface.

** Context Menu
The HareSVN context menu shall provide the following commands.

- [X] commit
- [X] update
- [X] resolve
- [X] --
- [X] add
- [ ] import
- [ ] rename
- [X] delete
- [X] revert
- [ ] ignore

- [X] show log
- [X] check for mod
- [X] --
- [ ] branch/tag
- [ ] switch
- [ ] merge
- [ ] --
- [X] cleanup
- [ ] relocate

** Forms
Subversion commands are invoked via descriptive dialogs.

You can of course customize the default values of the widgets for
every Subversion command individually.

** Command Execution
The process buffer captures information about the executed version
control command.  The window closes automatically when the command
succeeds.  Of course, this feature can be customized.
